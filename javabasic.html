				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>

				<p>
				Java script is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the object of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

				<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="#">Variable Declaration </a>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values – imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These names are called identifiers. <span class="b">var x;</span>
				</li>

				<li> 
				<a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operation assigns values to JavaScript variables –our cup now has coffee poured in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="b">
				var x=10;</span>
				</li>

				<li>
				<a href="#">Data types</a> Data types are a important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. These are six data types that are JavaScript pritives: Boolean – true or false; null – nil aka nothing; Number -<span class="b">42</span> or <span class= "b">3.14159;</span> String -<span class ="b">"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>; Array –<span class="b">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span>; and Object – <span class="b">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: "Doe"}</span>
				</li>

				<li>
				<a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to preform different actions for different decisions – hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You use conditional statement in your code to accomplish this. These are the following conditinal statements<span class="b"> if </span>a specific conditon is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="b">else if </span>to specify a new conditon to test, if the first condtion is false; <span class="b">else</span> we execute this block of code.</li>

				<li> 
				<a href="#">Loop</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>

				<li>
				<a href="#">Funtion</a> Funtions are an encapsulation of ta code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk form Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up Done! We finished our instruction. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.</li>
